go to the releases tab for the code
the windows smartscreen guy will block the installer exe from running since im broke and i am not getting it to have the official publisher thing on it
since it's an installer, it installs files, which is considered modifying your system, so after you skip the windows guy, UAC will step in and tell you: "this guy gonna change sum shit to your device and idk what it can do and idc enough to see what it does". the installer is safe tho
