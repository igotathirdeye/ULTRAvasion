RULES FOR USING MY GAME!
========================
1. accessing my game's code is perfectly fine as of the latest version.
2. you can modify, fix, do whatever to my code for personal use.
3. forks, and all modifications of my code for others to use must credit ME.
4. do NOT reuse ANY chunk of my code to replicate or just mimic how my game works without credit.
